        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular because of its easy syntax, vast libraries, and versatility in areas like web development, data science, and cybersecurity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings, such as if, else, while, for, def, return, True, False, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have predefined meanings in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Mutability refers to whether an objectâ€™s value can be changed after creation. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Lists are mutable because they allow modifications like adding, removing, or changing elements. Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation, which makes them more memory-efficient and safer in certain cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "== checks for value equality (whether two variables have the same value).\n",
        "\n",
        "is checks for identity equality (whether two variables refer to the same memory location).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "and (both conditions must be true)\n",
        "\n",
        "or (at least one condition must be true)\n",
        "\n",
        "not (negates a condition)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Type casting is converting one data type into another, such as converting an integer to a string (str(10)) or a float to an integer (int(3.5)).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit casting: Python automatically converts data types (e.g., int to float during operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit casting: The programmer manually converts data types using functions like int(), float(), and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Conditional statements (if, elif, else) allow Python programs to execute different code blocks based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "elif (short for \"else if\") allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially. If the if condition is false, Python evaluates elif conditions before executing the else block.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "for loops iterate over sequences (lists, strings, etc.) for a predetermined number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "while loops run as long as a condition remains true.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "When the number of iterations is unknown in advance, a while loop is better. For example, reading user input until they enter \"exit\" requires a while loop:\n",
